# Life_Expectancy_GDP
With this data set, we look at six different countries and their GDPs over a 15 year period. The countries in quesiton are Chile, Zimbabwe, Germany, China, the United States of America and Mexico. Our goal is to look for any relationships we can find between life expectancy and GDP and then try to understand why that relationship may exist.
